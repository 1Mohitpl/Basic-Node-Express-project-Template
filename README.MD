This is an Basic Example Nodejs project Templete, which anyone can use it.
It has been build on top off the most important coding principles and project management 
recommendations. Feel free to change anything.


- `src` -> Inside this folder all the code of this project will reside, this will not 
Include any kind of tests.

Lets take a look inside the `src` folder

- `config`-> In this folder we are warpping up all our project configurations or setup 
 of a library or module will be done. For example: setting up `dotenv` so that we can 
 able to use the environment variables at anyother folder whenever is needed and it 
 is a efficient way to write cleaner code. this is done in the `server-config.js` folder.

- `routes`-> In this folder we are register a route and the corresponding middleware and controllers to it.
